still two people that it could be
will narrow down based on flight

 SELECT * FROM flights WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 29;

SELECT p.name
FROM people p
JOIN passengers ps ON p.passport_number = ps.passport_number
WHERE ps.flight_id = 36
AND p.name IN ('Bruce', 'Diana');

This returned bruce only so bruce is the thief
to find accomplice look at who bruce called

SELECT p.name, pc.caller, pc.receiver, pc.year, pc.month, pc.day, pc.duration
FROM phone_calls pc
JOIN people p ON pc.caller = p.phone_number
WHERE pc.year = 2021 AND pc.month = 7 AND pc.day = 28 AND pc.duration < 60;

Bruce called this number (375) 555-8161, so find the person based on this number

SELECT name, phone_number FROM people WHERE phone_number = '(375) 555-8161';
