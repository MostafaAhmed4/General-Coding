Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Prediction accuracy increasing more after 1000

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would consider 1000 good enough, I paid particular attention to Japan and it's percentages would only vary from 1.3 - 1.7 percentage chance of winning so i think 1000 gets the job done efficiently
